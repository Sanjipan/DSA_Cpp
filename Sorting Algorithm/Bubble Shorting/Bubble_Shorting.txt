Bubble Short Algorithm :
Theory :

-> Bubble sort is the simplest sorting Algorithm that works by represtedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
-> This algorithm is suitable for small data sets.
-> It is known as bubble sort, because with wvwry complete itreation the largest element bubbles up towards the last place or the highest index just like a water bubble rises up to the water surface.

-> Time Complexity : O(n^2)

Working :

1> Starting with the first elemt(index = 0), compare the current element with the next element of the array.
2> If the current element is greater than then next element of the array, swap them.
3> If the current element is less than the next element, move to the next element.
4> Repeat (1>) till the list is sorted.

Bubble Short Algorithm :

a: array of items
n: size of list

Starting
1. declare variables - i,j
2. loop:(i=0 to i<n)
    2.1. loop :(j = 0 to j , n -i -1)
        2.1.1. if(a[j]>a[j+1])
                2.1.1.1. swap(a[j], a[j+1])
                end if
            end loop
        end loop
    stop


Optimized Bubble Short  :

a: array of items
n: size of list

Starting
1. declare variables - i,j
2. loop:(i=0 to i<n)
    2.1 flag = false
    2.2 loop : (j = 0 to j < n-i-1)
        2.2.2 if(a[j] > a[j+1])
                2.2.2.1 flag = true
                2.2.2.2 swap(a[j], a[j+1])
                end if
            end loop
    2.3 if(flag == false) then break
    end loop
stop
