Sorting Algorithms in Data Structure

What is Shorting Algoriths ?
 
 A shorting algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list DS elements according to a particuar pattern( e.g. Ascending or Descending order).
The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in respective data structure.

Why do we need Sorting Algorithms ?
 
 1. Efficent soring is important for optimizing the effecency of other algorithms (such as search and mearge algorithms) which requires input datato be in sorted lists.
 2. Producing more human readable output.
 3. It is easier and faster to locate items in a sorted list and then unsorted.

Types of Shorting Algorithm ?
 1. Selection shorting
 2. Bubble Shorting
 3. Insertion Sorting
 4. Merge Shorting
 5. Quick Sorting
 6. Heap Sorting
 7. Radix Shorting
 8. Bucket Shorting
