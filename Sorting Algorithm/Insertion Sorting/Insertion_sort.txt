Insertion Short Algorithm -
Theory -
->  Insertion Short is a simple Algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.
->  Insertion Short is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the finel shorted array (or List) one item at a time.
->  Efficient for(quite) small data sets, much like other quadratic shorting algorithms.
->  More efficient in practice than most of other simple quadratic(i.e.:O(n^2)) sorting algorithm such as selection short or bubble short.
->  Time Complexity : O(n^2)

Insertion Short Algorithm :-

1> pick next elemnt
2> Compare wwith all element in the shorted sub-list on the left.
3> Shift all the elements in the shorted sub-list that is greater than the value to be shorted
4> Insert the value
5> Represent until list is shorted
