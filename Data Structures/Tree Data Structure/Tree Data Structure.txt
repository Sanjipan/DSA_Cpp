                            Tree Data Structure

whats is data structure :
Data structure is way of storing/organizing data in the memory, in such a way that access, management & modification becomes efficient.

Which Data structure to use :
1> what data neet to be stored 
2> cost of opperation (read,write,update etc)
3> memory usage & efficiency
4> ease of implementation
5> maintainablity


Linear data structure :

array
stack
queue
linekd list

Non Linear data structure :
Tree
graphs


Tree Data structure :

Tree : A tree is a non linear data structure that simulates a hirearchical tree structure with a root of values & subtrees of childeren with parent node represented as a set of linked nodes.

Terms :

1. Root : Root is a special node in a tree . The entire tree is referenced through it. It does not have a parent.
2. Parent node : Parent node is an immidiate predecessor of a node.
3. Child Node : All immidiate sucessor of a node are its child.
5. Leaf Node : Last node in the tree. There is no node after this node.
6. Edge : Edge is a connection between one node to another . It is a line between two nodes or a node and a leaf.
7. Path : Path is a number of successive edge from source node to destination node.
8. Degree of Node : Degree of a node is equal to number of childeren a node have.

Important Tree terms :

1> Tree can be termed as a RECURSIVE data structure.
2> In a valid tree for N nodes we have N-1 edges/links.
3> Depth of node : the no. of edges from the tree root node to the node.
4> Height of node : the no. of edges on the longest path between that node and a leaf.
5> Height of a node : Height of a tree is the Height of its root node.
